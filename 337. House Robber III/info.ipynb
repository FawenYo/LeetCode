    "## Question\n",
    "\n",
    "The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the `root` of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.\n",

    "```shell\n",
    "Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]\n",
    "Output: 7\n",
    "Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.\n",
