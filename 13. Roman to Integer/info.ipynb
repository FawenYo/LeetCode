    "Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: $I$, $V$, $X$, $L$, $C$, $D$ and $M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Symbol | Value  |\n",
    "| ------ | ------ |\n",
    "| $I$    | $1$    |\n",
    "| $V$    | $5$    |\n",
    "| $X$    | $10$   |\n",
    "| $L$    | $50$   |\n",
    "| $C$    | $100$  |\n",
    "| $D$    | $500$  |\n",

    "For example, $2$ is written as $II$ in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. $12$ is written as $XII$, which is simply $X + II$. The number $27$ is written as $XXVII$, which is $XX + V + II$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not $IIII$. Instead, the number four is written as $IV$. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as $IX$. There are six instances where subtraction is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $I$ can be placed before $V$ (5) and $X$ (10) to make 4 and 9.\n",
    "* $X$ can be placed before $L$ (50) and $C$ (100) to make 40 and 90.\n",
    "* $C$ can be placed before $D$ (500) and $M$ (1000) to make 400 and 900.\n",

    "```shell\n",

    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Input: s = \"IX\"\n",
    "Output: 9\n",

    "### Example 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Input: s = \"LVIII\"\n",
    "Output: 58\n",
    "Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Input: s = \"MCMXCIV\"\n",
    "Output: 1994\n",
    "Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $1 \\leq s.length \\leq 15$\n",
    "* $s$ contains only the characters ('$I$', '$V$', '$X$', '$L$', '$C$', '$D$', '$M$')\n",
    "* It is **guaranteed** that s is a valid roman numeral in the range $[1, 3999]$."
